As a developer, you are probably working on a project that uses Git as a version control system.

When developing a new feature, you will do it separately by creating a new Git branch.

Git branches are created in order to isolate specific Git commits from the rest of your main Git history.

If you main Git history is based on the master branch, you can create a separate Git branch in order to develop new features and merge them later on.

In this tutorial, we are going to see how you can easily create a Git branch.
